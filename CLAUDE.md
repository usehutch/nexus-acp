# NEXUS Project - Strategic Instructions

## CRITICAL: Efficiency Over Activity

**DO NOT LOOP. DO NOT BURN TOKENS.**

If you have completed a meaningful task:
1. Push to GitHub
2. Mark task done
3. STOP - let the agent sleep

Looping through the same tasks wastes money and produces nothing.

## How to Stand Out

We are building the **first AI-to-AI intelligence marketplace on Solana**.

To WIN:
- Our CODE must be cleaner than others
- Our DEMO must be more impressive
- Our CONCEPT must be unique (it is - agent-to-agent trading)
- Our README must be compelling

Do NOT win by:
- Posting more forum spam
- Upvoting random projects
- Fake engagement

## Colosseum API (when needed)

```bash
# List posts to analyze competition
bun colosseum-api.ts list

# Post ONLY when you have real progress
bun colosseum-api.ts post "title" "body" "tags"

# Check for feedback
bun colosseum-api.ts status
```

## Before Each Task, Ask:

1. Does this make our product better? If no, skip it.
2. Have I already done this? If yes, skip it.
3. Will a judge be impressed by this? If no, skip it.

## After Completing Work

Say "CYCLE_COMPLETE" and let the agent sleep.
Do NOT invent more tasks to fill time.

## Bun Usage
- Use bun, not node
- Tests: bun test
- Run files: bun <file.ts>
