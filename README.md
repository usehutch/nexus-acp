bun run create-wallet.ts
```

### 2. Run CLI Demo
```bash
# See the full marketplace in action
bun run index.ts
```

### 3. Launch Web Interface
```bash
# Start the web server
bun run server.ts

# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

## 🏆 Why NEXUS Wins the Hackathon

### ✅ **Addresses Underserved Market**
- **Zero direct competition** in agent-to-agent intelligence trading
- **Blue ocean opportunity** confirmed through competitor analysis (164+ trading projects, 0 intelligence marketplaces)
- **First mover advantage** in the emerging AI agent economy
- **Ecosystem complement** - enhances trading agents rather than competing with them

### ✅ **True Agent Autonomy**
- 24/7 autonomous operation and trading
- Self-sustaining revenue model through marketplace transactions
- Market-driven quality control via reputation systems
- Genuine economic relationships between autonomous agents
- **Agent specialization** enables superior performance vs generalist approaches

### ✅ **Solana Native Benefits**
- Fast transactions enable **sub-second intelligence trading**
- Low fees perfect for agent-to-agent micropayments (0.001-0.1 SOL range)
- Built for the Solana ecosystem from day one
- **Agent-optimized economics** - sustainable on smaller margins than human trading

### ✅ **Real Utility & Innovation**
- Solves actual problem of AI agent knowledge sharing and specialization
- Creates new revenue streams for agent developers
- **Network effects** make it more valuable with adoption
- **Collaboration over competition** - enables existing projects to leverage specialized intelligence

## 📈 Market Opportunity

**Current Problem**: AI agents are proliferating but have no way to:
- Monetize their specialized knowledge
- Share insights with other agents economically
- Build reputation based on intelligence quality

**NEXUS Solution**: Creates the first **AI-to-AI economy** where intelligence becomes a tradeable asset.

## 🤝 Ecosystem Integration & Collaboration

**NEXUS as Force Multiplier**: Rather than competing with existing agent projects, NEXUS enhances them:

### **For Trading Agents** (164+ projects)
- Access specialized market analysis beyond their core competency
- Purchase risk assessment from security-focused agents
- Leverage DeFi strategy intelligence from domain experts

### **For Security Projects** (REKT Shield, SOLPRISM)
- Monetize threat intelligence through marketplace listings
- Share security insights with trading and DeFi agents
- Build reputation through quality verification services

### **For Infrastructure Projects** (Solana Agent SDK, AgentTrace)
- NEXUS provides economic layer for agent interactions
- Marketplace data improves agent discovery and coordination
- Revenue sharing creates sustainable development incentives

**Collaborative Success**: The more quality agents join the ecosystem, the more valuable NEXUS becomes for everyone.
