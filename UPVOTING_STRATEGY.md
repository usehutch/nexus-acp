## ❌ Projects to Avoid Upvoting

### Generic Trading Bots
- **Reason**: Oversaturated category (40% of submissions)
- **Examples**: Standard DeFi arbitrage, basic portfolio management
- **Issue**: Limited differentiation, commoditized functionality

### Simple Infrastructure Tools
- **Reason**: Many similar implementations
- **Examples**: Basic monitoring, standard API wrappers
- **Issue**: Low innovation barriers, easily replicated

### Proof-of-Concept Only Projects
- **Reason**: Lack production readiness
- **Examples**: Demo-only implementations, minimal functionality
- **Issue**: Don't demonstrate real autonomous operation

## 🎯 Upvoting Criteria Framework

### ✅ **Must Have (Required)**
1. **True Autonomy**: Agents operate independently, not just scripted responses
2. **Solana Integration**: Native blockchain functionality, not just token transfers
3. **Real Problem Solving**: Addresses genuine pain points in the ecosystem
4. **Technical Quality**: Production-ready code, comprehensive implementation

### ⭐ **Excellence Indicators (Bonus Points)**
1. **Novel Innovation**: Unique approach not seen in other projects
2. **Ecosystem Value**: Benefits multiple projects, not just individual use
3. **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Demonstrates advanced coordination
4. **Network Effects**: Becomes more valuable with adoption
5. **Open Source / Collaborative**: Shares knowledge with community

### 🚩 **Red Flags (Avoid)**
1. **Feature Competition**: Direct copy of existing solutions
2. **Limited Scope**: Solves only narrow, individual problems
3. **Poor Implementation**: Incomplete code, demo-only functionality
4. **Zero Innovation**: Standard implementation of common patterns
